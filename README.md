Practical Considerations for Keystroke Dynamics

Keystroke dynamics is a biometric method that analyzes typing patterns for continuous and unobtrusive user authentication.  However, keystroke dynamics has faced challenges that restrict widespread adoption.  Keystroke dynamics relies on continuous tracking of user typing patterns.  This is accomplished by installing a keystroke logger on the users machine that captures all of the keys the users types.  This creates concerns about privacy.  Users may be uncomfortable with the idea of their typing behavior being constantly monitored or analyzed, even if it is to their benefit.   Important considerations needs to be addressed for this technology to become widely accepted as a trusted and secure method for continued authentication.  This provides a working solution towards a more secure dataset collection method to address these security and trust concerns by collecting only specific, common digraphs for keystroke analysis.
